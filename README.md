This repository contains an implementation of the Simplex Method for solving linear programming problems, written in C. The program calculates the optimal solution to a linear optimization problem given constraints and an objective function.

**Features :**

        Solves linear programming problems in standard form.
        Handles multiple variables and constraints.
        Provides the optimal solution and the maximum value of the objective function.
        Detects unbounded problems and displays appropriate warnings.

**How to Use :**

        1. Clone the Repository
        
                git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simplex-method-c.git
                cd simplex-method-c
                
        2. Compile the Program
        
                gcc simplex.c -o simplex
                
        3. Run the Program
        
                ./simplex
                
        4. Input Format
                Enter the number of variables in the objective function.
                Enter the number of constraints.
                Provide:
                        - Coefficients of the objective function.
                        - Coefficients and constants for the constraints.

**Code Overview :**

        simplex(): Core function implementing the Simplex algorithm.
        main(): Handles user input and invokes the simplex() function.
        
**Limitations :**

        Only works with problems in standard form (all constraints are â‰¤).
        Assumes input data is valid.
